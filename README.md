# twitter_rest_assured_project
This is a sample project testing the Twitter API using the rest assured framework.


This is Sanderson's example API level automation framework which demonstrates the use of the Rest Assured framework.
Abstractions and POJO have been used in the projects.

*Note in order to use the full project a properties file will be requied which store the OAuth details required to run against the API.
also please do ensure you create an app using  https://apps.twitter.com link this is a mandatory requirement this links your Twitter account
so the API is available for use. I have removed the file from the project for security purposes.

-All dependencies are managed through the pom.xml file

-Junit is test framework used 

-Java JDK 8 used for the platform
